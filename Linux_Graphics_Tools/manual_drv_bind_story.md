ChatGPT left out, you need to stop all processes locking the driver from proper unbinding or you will have issues. Make sure to pause the containers, stop GPUParted,then make your change, restart GPUParted, and make sure any of the user space containers, vms are able to properly load back any processes and memory "they think" they already have onto a new slate from the GPU and restart all the cuda_kernels or whatever, loading and addressing the VRAM and everything may be special, and the transparency of this being done may not yet be possible to make transparent to the apps, so be aware your VM might fail when it loads, but if this ever exists and is possible a hook for early fail will made avail to your app so you can easily handle a vm unpause that doesn't have the same handles. Okay, Okay I am dreaming of this being possible for now GPUParted does not yet exist for me, but still before binding new drivers, you need to somehow free the gpu from all processes. This means you really have to monky with GDM for the computer only nvidia card if it is not your primary, again I think it is manageable from the 61-gdm.rules under /usr/lib/sysd/ I think??

Creating a script similar to driverctl, a tool for managing device driver bindings in Linux, involves  
interacting with the sysfs filesystem to bind and unbind drivers for specific devices. The original  
driverctl tool is more comprehensive and includes features for persistent driver overrides. However,  
I can provide a simplified version that covers basic functionality: binding and unbinding drivers,  
along with performing initial checks for permissions and required directories. 

This simplified script will demonstrate how to:  
- Check if the script is run with root privileges.   
- Verify that the sysfs filesystem is accessible.   
- Bind or unbind a driver to a device based on command-line arguments.  
  
Disclaimer: This script is for educational purposes. Be cautious when binding or unbinding drivers, as incorrect usage may lead to system instability.

How to Use This Script 
- Save the script to a file, for example, simple_driverctl.sh.   
- Make it executable: chmod +x simple_driverctl.sh.   
- Run it with root privileges: sudo ./simple_driverctl.sh -b <driver> -d <device_id> to bind, or sudo ./simple_driverctl.sh -u <driver> -d <device_id> to unbind.   
- Replace <driver> with the name of the driver and <device_id> with the ID of the device.   

This script is a basic representation and does not cover all functionalities of driverctl, such as listing devices or managing persistent driver overrides.   
For comprehensive device management, consider using the actual driverctl tool or refer to its source for more advanced features.
