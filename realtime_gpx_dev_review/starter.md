  - Utilized by developers to provide hardware-agnostic upscaling solutions.
- **Compile Time**:
  - Developers predefine configurations to toggle FSR in graphics settings menus.
- **Run Time**:
  - Game engines dynamically adjust resolution scaling based on FPS targets and system performance.

#### **Real-ESRGAN**
- **Development Phase**:
  - Integrated into texture pipelines for pre-processing high-resolution textures before compilation.

- **Run Time**:
  - Occasionally used for enhancing textures dynamically in specific engines, like modded workflows in Godot or Unity.

#### **NVIDIA NIS**
- **Development Phase**:
  - Integrated into the graphics pipeline to enhance spatial resolution in viewport rendering.
- **Compile Time**:
  - Developers configure dynamic toggles to enable/disable NIS based on target platforms.
- **Run Time**:
  - NIS upscales rendered images in real-time, dynamically sharpening details.

#### **OpenPose**
- **Development Phase**:
  - Extensively used for motion capture and pose estimation in animation workflows.
- **Compile Time**:

### **Handling Anticipation in Development**
1. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Developers anticipate computational overhead by offering **adaptive settings** for these technologies (e.g., toggling FSR or NIS dynamically based on performance).
   - Pre-rendering workflows with tools like **Real-ESRGAN** reduce runtime demands.

2. **Plug-in Modularity**:
   - Studios design these integrations as **plugins** or **modular tools**, allowing developers to include or exclude specific technologies as needed.

3. **Dynamic Integration Checks**:
   - During runtime, game engines or applications monitor system performance and adjust the **level of upscaling or enhancement dynamically** to ensure smooth operation.
