#### Debootstrap is handy, but you could do this with chroot only, actually it seems to make more sense in the past when using chroot only, just have to remember how to bind the proc, and other directories. Last time you had to do this chroot binding when you made some changes to a chromeos system so you know it by heart, every system update has normally always started in chroot when I was doing a lot of practice via nodes on the cloud years ago, and seems like needed chroot to fix mbr boot stuff, and grub stuff often too, it was common occurance, so common it was annoying and now as of today, I am not sure what I was doing exactly, ahh I remember, I was wanting grub2 before it was default or something... Anyways I kept breaking stuff years ago, I also did a lot of chroot stuff in something called colinux, which is how I originally tried every distro out there, particularily found gentoo interesting... but certaintly did not understand everything I was doing at the time, and this also the year when I first encountered openwrt and got my first real world networking and wifi introductions, before I didn't network, I just connected.
