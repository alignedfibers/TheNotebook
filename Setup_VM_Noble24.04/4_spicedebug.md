### Spice mouse bounds are not being handled on spice-vdagent in ubuntu correctly 
***(causes mouse stop at border of spiceclient viewer surface & does not move to the external screen)***

***(this issue does not happen in ChromeOS Flex or Windows just Ubuntu)***

***(Genuinely not fixable in this OS without doing usb redirect or passthrough usb device meaning you have to have more than one mouse connected, annoying, it is not a simple fix. Chris Titus uses the network mouse.. but yeah that opens up a possible security flaw as it is in plain text over network, not sure if that will even work in my use case.)***

#### TODO Automatically attaching the spice-server debug qemu hook script using custom element within the libvirt qemu domain element and external DTD. Its code.

#### TODO Redirect debug from vdagent to log on host via serial device under the current vm.

#### TODO Create a folder tree for my custom continue.sh, helpers, and logs to live.

#### TODO Create a qemu hook that handles the vm start event and creates a custom continue.sh per vm.

#### TODO Create wrap for virt-viewer used by virtmanager and add the spice-client debug.
#### TODO Create the DTD that will be able to be specified in the xmlns allowing the custom element in the libvirt domain.xml config for each vm.
